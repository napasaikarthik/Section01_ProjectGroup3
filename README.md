# TWITTER ANALYSIS

# OVERVIEW

Twitter is one of the popular social network where people post their views on everything from their personal problems to social issues. They also discuss about all the topics in the world. 7168 tweets are produced every second. All the predictions on sports, politics and all the data for analysis on social issues are taken form twitter posts. By using this data, we can represent what people are thinking.

# DATASETS:

+ Finding data using twitter is very simple because each topic is mentioned using a hashtag. Every hash tag helps the users to follow them and retweet accordingly. In our project we are going to use hash tags to track down the user post on the topic.
The data we collect from twitter is not structured. So we try to retrieve only location, timestamp, message, and hashtag used. We can use different tools to represent the data some of the potential tools I have explored are Splunk and microstrategy. These tools are even used in bigdata applications
We collect all this data using the twitter API, which help us to retrieve the data using the python code.

# RESEARCH QUESTIONS

Now we are going to retrieve the tweets on the present presidential elections.
•	Which states in the country are showing interest in the presidential elections?
•	Which candidate is being more popular in the discussions?
•	How many users are active on a particular GOP?
•	What is the time period where the users are active?
